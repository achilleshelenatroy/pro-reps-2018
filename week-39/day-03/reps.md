## **One hour or less Repetition Drill**

## The reps that are about to follow should approximately take a hour or less including the time it takes to refer back to the pilots and grasp some things you had left out before. 

## **Reps**

### **1.** create a bash script named "rep" but don't execute it on Kali Linux. Just commit the script to your `pro-reps-2018`. The "rep" bash script should perform the following objectives:

### - check the current working directory
### - make sure the current working directory is user's home directory 
### - see the manual of touch
### - see the manual of ls
### - create a directory named "fast"
### - create a directory named "furious"
### - create a file named "fst.txt" inside "fast" directory 
### - enter the absolute pathname leading to the "fst.txt" file


### **2.** create a bash script named "defend" but don't execute it on Kali Linux. Just commit the script to your `pro-reps-2018`. The "defend" bash script should perform the following objectives:

### - create a directory named "milestone" 
### - check the current working directory
### - change the current working directory to a folder inside the root directory named "boot" 
### - enter the absolute pathname for "boot directory
### - create a directory named "faster" inside "milestone" 
### - output a message to the temrinal screen. The message should be "no days off". 
### - create a comment that says "Mcdonalds, I'm hungry" 
### - execute the "rep" script you have written above assuming that the "rep" file is in the "usr" directory inside the root directory.
